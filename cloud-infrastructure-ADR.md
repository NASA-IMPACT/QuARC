# pyQuARC as a service: cloud infrastructure

* Status: proposed
* Deciders: @xhagrg
* Date: 2022-04-21

## Context and Problem Statement

pyQuARC is an open source metadata quality assessment tool. Many projects at IMPACT are looking to utilize pyQuARC's assessment for their own metadata. Thus, a need to serve pyQuARC as a service has arisen.

This Architecture Decision Record (ARD) lists the decisions made to create this service.
